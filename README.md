## About the Game

This Memory Card Game is a classic matching pairs game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a fully responsive design. It challenges the player's memory by requiring them to find pairs of matching cards hidden face down on a grid. This game includes timing, score tracking, and a restart feature to enhance the experience.

Designed with a mobile-first approach, the game adapts smoothly to all screen sizes—from the smallest mobile phones to large desktop monitors and TV displays—ensuring a seamless experience on any device.

## How to Play

- Click on a card to flip and reveal its symbol.
- Click a second card to find the matching pair.
- If both cards match, they stay flipped face up.
- If the cards do not match, they flip back face down after a short delay.
- The goal is to match all pairs as quickly as possible and achieve the highest score.
- Score increases by 10 points for each match and decreases by 2 points for each mismatch.
- The timer starts automatically when the game begins.
- You can restart the game any time using the "Restart Game" button, which resets the timer and shuffles the cards.

## Game Rules and Regulations

- Only two cards can be flipped at any given time.
- Cards that have been matched remain face up and cannot be flipped back.
- The game finishes when all pairs have been correctly matched.
- Points and time taken are tracked and displayed during the game.
- The game is intended for solo play but can be adapted for multiplayer turn-based sessions.
